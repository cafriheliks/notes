- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

1. Prioritize tasks: When you are working on a project, it is essential to determine which tasks are the most important and which can be completed later. By prioritizing your tasks in this way, you can ensure that you focus on the critical aspects of the project and not get sidetracked by less significant details. Use task management tools, such as Trello or Asana, to help keep track of your priorities. 
 2. Plan ahead: Planning is crucial for any project. When starting a new project or undertaking a large task, take the time to plan out the steps you need to take and the resources you will need. Creating a detailed plan will ensure you have a clear understanding of what needs to happen and when, allowing you and your team to stay on track and avoid any potential bottlenecks.  
3. Stay organized: As a programmer, maintaining a clean and organized workspace is vital for efficiency and productivity. Organize your code, project files, documentation, etc. in a way that makes sense to you. You can use version control systems, like Git, for your source code to keep everything up-to-date and easily accessible. Additionally, using code editors and IDEs, which offer features like code folding, autocomplete, debugging tools and more, can significantly improve your productivity and efficiency.

- Today's programming wisdom is to always prioritize code readability and maintainability. This means writing concise, well-structured, and easy-to-understand code that can be easily modified and expanded upon as needed. To achieve this, follow these best practices:

1. Use clear variable, function, method, class, module, etc. names that accurately represent their purpose and functionality.
2. Organize code into logical, modular blocks that follow a consistent structure and naming convention. For example, use the same naming pattern for related functions or classes. 
3. Comment your code to explain its purpose, input, output, assumptions, edge cases, or any other aspects that may not be immediately apparent. Avoid excessive commenting, however, as it can clutter the code and make it harder to read. Instead, focus on providing just enough context to help others understand the logic and purpose of the Code.  
4. Write code with the assumption that others may need to understand and modify it in the future. Follow coding conventions and standards that are common in your programming language and/or project to ensure that your Code is consistent and easily digestible.   
5. Refactor and optimize your codes as you go, looking for opportunities to simplify and clean up your work. By doing this regularly, you can avoid large-scale refactoring projects that often lead to more errors and increased development time.    
6. Learn and use version control systems, such as Git, to track and manage your changes. Not only does this help with collaboration, but it also allows you to easily revert to previous versions of your Codeto fix errors or make other changes more easily.     
7. Continuously learn and grow your knowledge of programming languages, frameworks, tools, best-practices, design patterns, et al. by reading documentation, blogs, books, tutorials, attending conferences, participating in online forums, talking to peers, mentors, colleagues, experts, tutors, teachers, friends, family, strangers, aliens, animals, plants, rocks, water, air, earth, fire, wind, lightning, thunder, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanoes, meteors, comets, asteroids, black holes, galaxies, stars, planets, moons, sun, moon, gravity, magnetism, electromagnetism.
